Test Specifications Document for TempCalculator Class:

### Test Case 1: Initialization

**WHEN:**
- An instance of TempCalculator is created.

**THEN:**
- The CurrentTemperature should be initialized to the default value of 20.0.
- The NumPassengers should be initialized to the default value of 0.

### Test Case 2: CalculateNewTemperature with Temperature Change

**WHEN:**
- CalculateNewTemperature is called with a different current temperature.

**THEN:**
- The method should calculate the new temperature based on the temperature difference.
- The CurrentTemperature should be updated accordingly.
- The method should return the correct new temperature.

### Test Case 3: CalculateNewTemperature with Passenger Count Change

**WHEN:**
- CalculateNewTemperature is called with a different number of passengers.

**THEN:**
- The method should calculate the new temperature based on the passenger count difference.
- The NumPassengers should be updated accordingly.
- The method should return the correct new temperature.

### Test Case 4: CalculateNewTemperature with Both Temperature and Passenger Count Change

**WHEN:**
- CalculateNewTemperature is called with changes in both current temperature and passenger count.

**THEN:**
- The method should calculate the new temperature based on both temperature and passenger count differences.
- The CurrentTemperature and NumPassengers should be updated accordingly.
- The method should return the correct new temperature.

### Test Case 5: CalculateNewTemperature with No Change

**WHEN:**
- CalculateNewTemperature is called with the same current temperature and passenger count.

**THEN:**
- The method should not modify the CurrentTemperature or NumPassengers.
- The method should return the same current temperature.

### Test Case 6: CalculateNewTemperature with Negative Temperature Difference

**WHEN:**
- CalculateNewTemperature is called with a negative temperature difference.

**THEN:**
- The method should handle negative temperature differences correctly.
- The CurrentTemperature should be updated accordingly.
- The method should return the correct new temperature.

### Test Case 7: CalculateNewTemperature with Negative Passenger Count Difference

**WHEN:**
- CalculateNewTemperature is called with a negative passenger count difference.

**THEN:**
- The method should handle negative passenger count differences correctly.
- The NumPassengers should be updated accordingly.
- The method should return the correct new temperature.

### Test Case 8: CalculateNewTemperature with Zero Temperature and Passenger Count Difference

**WHEN:**
- CalculateNewTemperature is called with zero temperature and passenger count differences.

**THEN:**
- The method should not modify the CurrentTemperature or NumPassengers.
- The method should return the same current temperature.

These test cases cover various scenarios to ensure the correctness and robustness of the TempCalculator class.
